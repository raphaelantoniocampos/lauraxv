// ELEMENTS --------------------------------------------------------------------

/// A sequence lays elements out along the inline axis (horizontally for left-to-right
/// languages) unless the container is too narrow, in which case it lays them
/// out along the block axis (vertically for left-to-right languages) instead.
/// 
/// Media queries are often used to change the direction of a sequence based on
/// the width of the viewport, but the sequence element itself instead uses its
/// own width to determine the direction. To configure when the break happens,
/// you can use the `breakpoint` attribute: the default value is `30rem`.
/// 
/// While the sequence will break if the container gets too narrow, it will allow
/// its children to shrink to fit into the container. If you want to force the
/// container to break after a certain number of children regardless of the
/// container's width, you can use the `split` attribute. 
/// 
/// ðŸš¨ If the number of children to split on is greater than `10`, you must add
///    the following CSS to your own stylesheet for things to work properly,
///    replacing `X` with the number of children to split on:
/// 
/// ```css
/// .lustre-ui-sequence[data-split-at="X"] > :nth-last-child(n + X),
/// .lustre-ui-sequence[data-split-at="X"] > :nth-last-child(n + X) ~ * {
///    flex-basis: 100%;
/// }
/// ```
///

  attributes: List(Attribute(msg)),

/// By default, a sequence uses a `<div />` as the container element. If you want
/// to use a different element, you can use this function 
///

// ATTRIBUTES ------------------------------------------------------------------

/// This attribute determines the minimum width of the container before the
/// sequence breaks. The default value is `30rem` and any CSS length value is
/// valid.

///    flex-basis: 100%;
/// }

///    sequence would always break!

/// to use this function if you want a larger gap than `loose` or a smaller one
/// than `tight`.
