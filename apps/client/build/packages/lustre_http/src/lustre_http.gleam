///
/// ```gleam
/// import lustre_http as http
///
/// type Msg {
///   GotIpAddress(Result(String, http.HttpError))
///   WhoAmI
/// }
///
/// fn update(model, msg) {
///   case msg {
///     GotIpAddress(Ok(ip)) -> ...
///     GotIpAddress(Error(err)) -> ...
///     WhoAmI -> #(
///       model,
///       http.get("https://api.ipify.org", http.expect_text(GotIpAddress)
///     )
///   }
/// }
/// ```
///
/// If you need tighter control over the request - e.g. to set headers - you can
/// construct the request manually using the [gleam_http](https://hexdocs.pm/gleam_http/gleam/http/request.html)
/// package and then use [`send`](#send) instead.
